<p>
    I was just informed in a very polite way that I would not be extended a job by the company I had interviewed with yesterday.
    I already knew it was going to happen, but I really felt it when the actual email arrived.
    Below is my post-mortem analysis of what happened. I hope that you can learn from my mistakes as I have.
</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>
    Ultimately, I choked. I was presented a CS 101 problem, and I floundered. When I reflect back on what happened, it actually didn&#39;t start out too bad. I started thinking on how to solve the problem, started typing a bit, and then realized what I had typed wouldn&#39;t work. 
    I don&#39;t know why this was a problem, but for some reason the fact that I had made a mistake and would have to correct that caused me to panic.</p>
<p>
    It&#39;s hard to describe the feeling I felt, but it felt like the same feeling I had when I clipped the bike tire of a kid who rode out in front of my vehicle out of an alley a couple of years ago. Fortunately, the kid only had a couple of bruises and a few scratches and a bent tire on his bike. Our mental state, on the other hand, was in far worse condition. I had so many thoughts racing through my head of what I was supposed to do in the situation like ask where he hurt, make sure he didn&#39;t try to move too much if there were back injuries, etc. I knew what to do, but all I could actually seem to get my body to do was ask him over and over if he was OK.</p>
<p>
    It wasn&#39;t until I took my hands off the keyboard and grabbed a piece of paper and started trying to solve the problem there that I caught my first break. I am not sure what about this helped, because what I wrote down was just as non-sensical as the things I was typing, but perhaps it gave my brain enough time to re-assert some control over my body to get the message through that I had been looking for, which was what I needed to do. This got me back on track and I immediately got the problem 90% of the way done, but the damage was already done.</p>
<p>
    The same thing happened on the next problem, but this time it was because I had already shut down. All I could focus on was that I had completely failed the first problem.</p>
<h2>Keep Calm and Carry On</h2>
<p>As I look back on my botched interview I realized that there were some areas that could have changed the outcome of the interview. Some are things I could have done; some are things I should have known.</p>
<h3>Trust Yourself</h3>
<p>I distinctly remember one thought that kept occurring to me multiple times during the interview from my brain that could have turned everything around. I kept getting this thought that I should <strong>stop trying to solve the problem, collect myself and slow my breathing, then start from the beginning.</strong> If I had done this and told the interviewer how I was feeling, I think I could have avoided all the repeat problems because I would have stopped focussing on what <em>had happened</em> and focus on <em>what was next</em>.</p>
<h3>Talk, damnit!</h3>
<p>I think I was destined for failure before I even started the interview because I was already slightly anxious, and totally missed the key instruction that was given to me: to talk about what I was doing because <strong>the problem didn&#39;t matter, what they were interested in was how I approached the problem.</strong> If the problem didn&#39;t matter, then beating myself up over making minor mistakes became the biggest mistake I made in the entire interview. Once I started to panic, I don&#39;t know if I actually was capable of talking anymore, which is why I should have collected myself and calmed down so that I could do what I was there to do.</p>
<h3>The interviewer is your friend</h3>
<p>By far this is the <strong>most important thing I learned from looking back on the experience.</strong> I feel a bit foolish that I wasn&#39;t thinking this way before, but the person interviewing you is <em>on your team</em> and is rooting for you. The best thing that can happen for them is that you end up doing great in the interview and become a great member on their team. Sure, they are looking out for themselves and don&#39;t want to bring someone on who isn&#39;t going to meet their needs, but until they decide that you won&#39;t work out, you should believe that they are on your side. Unfortunately for me, I walked into the interview with the wrong mindset: I felt like I had to be the best that they had ever seen.</p>
<h3>Keep It Simple, Stupid</h3>
<p>On one problem, I had it mostly solved in my head, but when I began to actually implement my solution I stopped and went for another solution because I felt like it was too simple. I knew in my head that I could do this with one statement and didn&#39;t need to allocate an array and I got hung up on this notion. Yes, it is possible to do it in one statement, because I did it after the interview, but I was not able to do it without looking up the names and syntax for the methods that allowed me to do it in one statement. By feeling like I had to make an impressive solution, I committed myself to <em>no solution</em>.</p>
<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
<p>Even before being told that I would not be hired, I was already beating myself up a bit because I was fairly confident I was not going to be hired. I actually felt as though I was not good enough for the position, and that I had let myself down. Only one of those was true, and I&#39;m solving the other right now. I&#39;ve decided that even though I won&#39;t be hired, that doesn&#39;t say anything more than that. Just like a bad piece of code, I just need to fix the bug, make sure it doesn&#39;t happen again, and move on. For me, that means putting myself &quot;out there&quot; more. Looking back at this interview, I clearly have some issues when coding in front of others, so I&#39;m going to try to do some coding competitions to practice for the next time I have to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Ultimately, if you find yourself in a similar situation, just remember to <strong>focus on what&#39;s important, trust in yourself, and if things don&#39;t work out, learn from it and move on.</strong></p>
