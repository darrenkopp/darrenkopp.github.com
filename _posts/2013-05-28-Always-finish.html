<p class="jumbotron">When I played soccer in high school there is one thing that the coaches would constantly remind us of during
    any drill: "just finish.
    It doesn't matter how long it takes you or how badly you do it; just finish it."
</p>
<p>After a recent interview, I found myself repeating this to myself over and over after
    I had run out of time on the question.  In my heart, I knew that the 
    <a href="/posts/2013/04/19/Post-mortem-of-my-failed-interview.html">interview question doesn't matter, merely the process that you go through</a>
    , but it was bothering me that I had left the problem in an unsolved and broken state.
</p>
<p>I decided to finish it and send off the solution to the interviewer. I did not think it would help me out any, nor was that
    my intention, but it felt so much
    better once I knew in my heart that not only could I solve the problem, but that I had actually done it. When slogging through
    interviews, it's the little victories
    that matter the most.
</p>
<p>While I never thought about it outside of soccer, the idea should be applied to <em>any activity that you set out to complete</em>.
    Whether you are running
    marathons, practicing code kata's, reading a book, or learning a new language: 
    <strong>It doesn't matter how long it takes you or how badly you do it; just finish it</strong>.
