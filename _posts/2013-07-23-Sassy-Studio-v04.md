I'm excited to announce the 0.4 release of Sassy Studio which brings the biggest missing
functionality: automatic generation of CSS files. Right now it can only generate on save, but
I'm hoping to add support for generating on build as well.

If you don't need / want this functionality or have the CSS generated by another process like I do, you
can disable it in the options. 

Also in this release is better color matching, but there is still a lot to be desired here.

As always, you can grab it from within Visual Studio or [on the gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/85fa99a6-e4c6-4a1c-9f00-e6a8129b6f4d).
