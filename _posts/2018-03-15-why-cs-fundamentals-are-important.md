Rob Conery has released a new book called [The Imposter's Handbook](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook) for those in the software industry who don't have a strong background in computer science fundamentals. I haven't read the book so I can't comment on what it covers, but the concept has me reflecting on my own similar experience.

While I did attend some university and got about half way through a computer science degree before I dropped out. At the time, I didn't think I had missed out on anything because I had already taught myself everything I had encountered in school up until that point; I was always a semester ahead of my course work.

I realize now that I was pretty close to the promised land of computer science because I had just hit Big-O notation though at the time I thought it was _completely pointless_. At the time, I was somewhat correct, but looking back now I realize how wrong I was.

This idea still resonates with many other self-taught developers though. The easiest place to see this is the criticism of technical interviews and their focus on rote data structure / algorithm questions. Often the counter-argument is "I don't need to know this because I can just google it", which is a fairly valid response.

So why, exactly, should you care about computer science if you are already a good developer? Well, you don't, to an extent. You can be a succesful developer, at least for a while.

I was successful for years before I started diving deep into computer science on my own. I wasn't some prodigy, I was just riding the _effective application of computer science_ through my use of a DBMS. In fact, a large number of developers can, and are, successful because those fundamentals are baked into the frameworks that they are using.

At some point, though, you **will start hitting scaling problems** as you continue to be successful. Often times, the scale may not be as much as you would like. Sometimes, it will happen because you finally land that big client.

The classic example of this is you have a component that has some sort of double loop in it that works great with all of your existing clients who have a hundred items of something, and then you get that client who has a thousand, perhaps even ten thousand items, and everything suddenly starts falling over.

This is why many companies focus on ensuring that developers have a good grasp of data structures, algorithms, and their space / time complexity analysis during the interview process; they have hit the point where they can't scale further without doing things right. Furthermore, they can't afford to have people writing code that, when released, will immediately fall over under load.

So, if you've made it this far, I now make an appeal to you, reader. If you don't have a strong background in computer science, start today. You don't need it, but it can only make things better. Now is the greatest time to do such a thing because there's never been better access to that information. Whether you [read a book]((https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook)), take [an online course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms), or read blogs, there's a multitude of information out there for a reasonable price.
