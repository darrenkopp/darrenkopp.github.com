I just released a new version of [Sassy Studio](https://github.com/darrenkopp/SassyStudio) 
that addressed a couple of the biggest defects that it had:

- Automatic color selection
- Support for Comment / Uncomment selection
- Warnings for deprecated features

I tried to get automatic generation of .css files on save, but ran into some problems with NSass
that will have to be resolved before that is done, but the addition of the features above
definitely makes Sassy Studio suck less&#0153;.

You can grab the update from the Visual Studio extension manager or 
[you can download it from the Visual Studio Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/85fa99a6-e4c6-4a1c-9f00-e6a8129b6f4d)
