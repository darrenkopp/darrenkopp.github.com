<p class="jumbotron">When I'm coding at my peak, I'm removing more code than I'm adding. No, I'm not
    talking about <a title="The best code is no code at all" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/05/the-best-code-is-no-code-at-all.html">
    refactoring your code to be more terse or efficient</a>.
    I'm talking about writing code to play around with ideas or flush out an example API, then getting rid of all of it if it
    doesn't pan out.
</p>

<p>As I <a title="It’s OK to rewrite applications from scratch (sometimes)" href="http://darrenkopp.wordpress.com/2013/03/07/its-ok-to-rewrite-applications-from-scratch-sometimes/"
target="_blank">eluded to earlier</a>, on the last application I worked on I
    found it much easier to start over from scratch multiple times rather than try to
    go back and fix the code. Sometimes the code was this bad because it had been written
    usually under bad assumptions or a bad understanding of the problem, and thus was <em>fundamentally</em>
    wrong. Other times I just found that even though the code was right and worked correctly,
    it just didn't <em>feel</em> right or was not as easy to work with as I would like.
    Regardless of how or why the code was wrong, it had to go, and I didn't think twice
    about deleting it.
</p>

<p>I didn't necessarily scrap the entire application every time, but I would say between
    10 and 15 times I scrapped large parts of the application, sometimes the entire
    application. Writing code is the easy part, but solving the problem in the right
    way is <em>hard</em>. You don't need solve every problem on your first try, and
    many times you won't, so feel free to start over and keep iterating until you <strong>solve the problem in a way that is acceptable
        to you</strong>.
</p>

<p>Often, I would sketch out ideas on paper or try to figure things out in my head
    before trying to do the actual code. While in a lot of cases this was helpful, sometimes
    the solution I came up  just didn't work out as well in code as it had on paper.
    The only way to truly know how something will translate to code is by writing the
    code itself. This is similar to one of the primary benefits of <a title="Test Driven Development" href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDrivenDevelopment">test driven development</a>,
    though I find this process useful even before writing tests.
</p>

<p>Ultimately, the <strong>best</strong> reason to delete your code isn't about how
    pretty it is, how efficient it is, or how well commented it is. The best reason
    to delete your code is that you may not get another chance to rewrite it. You may
    find yourself stuck in a position where you are confined by the rules of your original
    code. As long as you are satisfied that you can live with those constraints, then
    sign off on that code and move on. <strong>Your code is your scratch pad, tear off sheets liberally until you are ready to paint</strong>.
