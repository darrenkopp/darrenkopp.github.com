    <p class="jumbotron">I am a software developer currently living in Maryland. I have a passion for the web.</p>
    <p>
    	When I'm not coding, I enjoy answering questions for people on StackOverflow.
	    I enjoy writing code in .NET and Javascript as well as many other languages I haven't tried yet or have not been invented yet.
    </p>
    <p>I love solving problems and am never afraid to try to solve something I don't understand.</p>
    <p>I'm currently working on important problems at <a href="https://homesnap.com">Homesnap</a>
